## Use in a prompt

Add "use context7" to any coding prompt so your assistant fetches fresh docs and examples:

```txt
Create a Next.js middleware that checks for a valid JWT in cookies and redirects unauthenticated users to /login. use context7
```

```txt
Configure a Cloudflare Worker script to cache JSON API responses for five minutes. use context7
```

## How it works

- Resolves library IDs and pulls versioned code docs/examples into context.
- Reduces hallucinations and outdated snippets.

## Next steps

- See Installation to connect Context7 MCP in your editor.
